1. Apply K-Means to your dataset. Use adjusted rand index to evaluate your results. Run K-Means for multiple rounds with different random initializations. Do the results vary for different initializations?

2. Evaluate how results change with respect to parameter K (using adjusted rand index). Since
random initialization impacts the results, run K-means multiple times and show the average result.

3. Apply Gaussian mixture model and evaluate the results (using adjusted rand index). Try several
different K.

4. Use PCA to reduce the feature space to 2 dimensions. Apply K-Means and Gaussian mixture to 2-
dimensional data. Compare the results using scatter plot. Try several different numbers of clusters.
